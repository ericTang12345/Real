No Warranties  
=============

The Application is provided to You "AS IS" and "AS AVAILABLE" and with all
faults and defects without warranty of any kind. To the maximum extent
permitted under applicable law, the Company, on its own behalf and on behalf
of its affiliates and its and their respective licensors and service
providers, expressly disclaims all warranties, whether express, implied,
statutory or otherwise, with respect to the Application, including all implied
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, title and
non-infringement, and warranties that may arise out of course of dealing,
course of performance, usage or trade practice. Without limitation to the
foregoing, the Company provides no warranty or undertaking, and makes no
representation of any kind that the Application will meet your requirements,
achieve any intended results, be compatible or work with any other software,
applications, systems or services, operate without interruption, meet any
performance or reliability standards or be error free or that any errors or
defects can or will be corrected.

Without limiting the foregoing, neither the Company nor any of the company's
provider makes any representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied:
(i) as to the operation or availability of the Application, or the

e-mails sent from or on behalf of the Company are free of viruses, scripts,
trojan horses, worms, malware, timebombs or other harmful components.

Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of certain types of warranties
or limitations on applicable statutory rights of a consumer, so some or all of
the above exclusions and limitations may not apply to You. But in such a case
the exclusions and limitations set forth in this section 11 shall be applied
to the greatest extent enforceable under applicable law. To the extent any
warranty exists under law that cannot be disclaimed, the Company shall be

for personal injury, loss of privacy arising out of or in any way related to
the use of or inability to use the Application, third-party software and/or
third-party hardware used with the Application, or otherwise in connection
with any provision of this Agreement), even if the Company or any supplier has
been advised of the possibility of such damages and even if the remedy fails
of its essential purpose.

Some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may
not apply to You.

=======================

Severability  
------------

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable or invalid,
such provision will be changed and interpreted to accomplish the objectives of
such provision to the greatest extent possible under applicable law and the
remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.

------

Except as provided herein, the failure to exercise a right or to require

ability to exercise such right or require such performance at any time
thereafter nor shall be the waiver of a breach constitute a waiver of any
subsequent breach.
